        <p>Termination of this Agreement will not limit any of the Company's rights or remedies at law or in equity in
          case of breach by You (during the term of this Agreement) of any of your obligations under the present
          Agreement.</p>

        <h1>Indemnification</h1>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Company and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees,
          agents, partners and licensors (if any) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys'
          fees, due to or arising out of your:
          (a) use of the Application; (b) violation of this Agreement or any law or regulation; or (c) violation of any
          right of a third party.</p>

        <h1>No Warranties</h1>
        <p>The Application is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without
          warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and
          on behalf of its affiliates and its and
          their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express,
          implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of
          merchantability, fitness for a particular
          purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
          performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
          undertaking, and makes no representation
          of any kind that the Application will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or
          work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any
          performance or reliability standards
          or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
          representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
          Application, or the information, content, and materials
          or products included thereon; (ii) that the Application will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the
          accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Application; or (iv)
          that the Application, its servers,
          the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses,
          worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
          statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
          But in such a case the exclusions and
          limitations set forth in this section 11 shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable
          law. To the extent any warranty exists under law that cannot be disclaimed, the Company, not the Application
          Store, shall be solely responsible
          for such warranty.</p>

        <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
          suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
          limited to the amount actually paid by You
          for the Application or through the Application.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable
          for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
          damages for loss of profits, loss of
          data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or
          in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or third-party
          hardware used with the Application,
          or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if the Company or any supplier has been
          advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
          the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You.</p>
        <p>You expressly understand and agree that the Application Store, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its
          licensors shall not be liable to You under any theory of liability for any direct, indirect, incidental,
          special consequential or exemplary damages
          that may be incurred by You, including any loss of data, whether or not the Application Store or its
          representatives have been advised of or should have been aware of the possibility of any such losses arising.
        </p>

        <h1>Severability and Waiver</h1>
        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and
          interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable
          law and the remaining provisions
          will continue in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2>Waiver</h2>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
          this Agreement shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any
          time thereafter nor shall be the waiver
          of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>

        <h1>Product Claims</h1>
        <p>The Company does not make any warranties concerning the Application. To the extent You have any claim arising
          from or relating to your use of the Application, the Company, not the Application Store, is responsible for
          addressing any such claims, which
          may include, but not limited to: (i) any product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Application fails
          to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) any claim arising under consumer
          protection, or similar legislation.</p>

        <h1>United States Legal Compliance</h1>
        <p>You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States
          government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a "terrorist supporting"
          country, and (ii) You are not listed on
          any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

        <p>The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. If a
          revision is material we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What
          constitutes a material change will be

        <p>By continuing to access or use the Application after any revisions become effective, You agree to be bound by
          the revised terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, You are no longer authorized to use the Application.
        </p>

          the Application. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or
          international laws.</p>

        <h1>Entire Agreement</h1>

          Application and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between You and the
